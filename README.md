## CI/CD Pipeline for Containerised Web App (Staging Deployment)

This repository contains a dummy web application and a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline that automates deployment to a staging environment on every push to the `develop` branch.

I have used the ASP.NET inbuilt app in Visual Studio 2022 and published it from Visual Studio to my GitHub.
